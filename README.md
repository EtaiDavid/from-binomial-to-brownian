# From Binomial to Brownian Motion

Understanding option pricing through the convergence from the discrete binomial model to the continuous Black-Scholes model.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how the binomial model for option pricing converges to the Black-Scholes model as the number of periods increases. The goal is to develop a deep understanding of the mathematical connection between discrete and continuous-time models in derivatives pricing.

## Current Status

🚧 **Project in early development** 🚧

The project structure is being set up. Content will be added progressively.

## Planned Structure

- **Random Walk fundamentals** - Understanding the discrete foundation
- **Brownian Motion** - Moving to continuous-time processes
- **Convergence analysis** - Bridging discrete and continuous models
- **Geometric Brownian Motion** - Modeling stock prices
- **Option pricing** - From binomial trees to Black-Scholes
- **Greeks and hedging** - Practical risk management

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks for demonstrations
